If their exploits make you swell with pride, the dreaded Ledo jump during Commando training will make your insides curl. “Commando, look straight," shouts the instructor from down. "Take a deep breath…now take a left turn… okay, now walk over”…tune in for more!

		HAWS – High Altitude Warfare School. This is the school that trains our soldiers to guard the Himalayan frontiers. Take an inside look at life in Siachen Glacier – the highest battlefield in the world. At 20,000 feet, this is where hell freezes over.  Normally, no one is allowed within about 50 km of this area unless you have Army clearance.  Nat Geo will also take you inside the Corps Battle School in the Kashmir Valley – where our Final 5 gets a taste of counter insurgency operations. The Mission isn’t even half-way through!

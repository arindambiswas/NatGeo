		Witty and full of one-liners to keep his friends in splits, 29 year-old Mandar joined Mission Everest from Mumbai.  The journey to Camp 1 of Mount Everest may perhaps have challenged that sense of humour a wee bit, but it definitely did not impact the steely determination within.  Mission Everest motivated him to join the armed forces, and today Mandar is a fighter pilot with the Indian Air Force and flies a Mirage 2000.

		This HR professional from Bengaluru was one of three women in the Final 5 of Mission Navy – talk about woman power! Chaitanya created history when she became the first woman to sail on an Indian Navy warship. In her own words: “I always aspired to be a part of the armed forces and Nat Geo's programme helped me realise it. I also feel that this is a triumph for all Indian women. For us nothing is impossible."

		Everything about Jitesh screamed “winner” when we first spotted him at the Mission Udaan trials in Delhi.  He had come all the way from Ludhiana to try out his luck and had declared his intentions of winning the Mission right up at the start! This peppy, full of life 28-year old attempted every task that he was given and the smile never left his face.  After he won Mission Udaan, the open skies were in his bloodstream and today, Jitesh is a pilot with a commercial airline.

		He was just 22 when he decided to take a break from life at sea with the merchant navy and joined the Bengaluru trials of Mission Udaan. He may have been attracted by the sky-diving shots he saw in the promo, but this strapping young lad didn’t shy away from a single task assigned to him. Today he flies a Boeing 737 with a commercial airline – we’re sure the nerves of steel will stand him in good stead there as well!

		He was quite the back-room boy that didn’t speak much during the qualifying rounds of Mission Udaan. His high scores in the SSB exams proved he was a man worth watching out for. As the 2nd runner up in Mission Udaan, he may never have got that ride in the grand prize – the Sukhoi 30 MKI - but toda,y as a fighter pilot in the Indian Air Force, he is commissioned to fly the coveted aircraft on missions around the globe!
